			   <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="mihinthale" style=width:1000px height:500px;>
			   <p>Rajarata University of Sri Lanka was established as the eleventh National University in Sri Lanka and was inaugurally opened on the 31st January 1996 by her Excellency President Chandrika Bandaranayake as per the Gazette Notification 896/2 and the University act 16 of 1978.<br><br> Sirimavo Bandaranayake, then Prime Minister, Hon. Speaker K.B. Rathnayake, Minister of Higher Education Richard Pathirana, Deputy Minister of Higher Education Wishwa Warnapala, Governor NCP Maithripala Senanayake, Chairman UGC Prof. S. Thilakaratne, The first Vice Chancellor of RUSL Prof. W.I. Siriweera graced the inaugural ceremony Dr. Jayantha Kelegama was the first chancellor of RUSL.It is quite significant that the RUSL was established in Mihintale, a sacred land which is a few kilometers away from the Historical Kingdom of Anuradhapura.<br><br> It is not an exaggeration to introduce Mihintale as the cradle of Buddhism, 15 km to the East of the Ancient Kingdom, Anuradhapura, a land gifted with ancient architecture and irrigation which paved the way through Buddhism for an  admirable life style and scholars of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka are fortunate to receive education in this seat of learning.<br><br>

Having examined the Social variables encountered by Sri Lanka in the two decades 1970 and 1980, the then government decided to establish Affiliated University colleges to provide opportunities for higher education for youth who are qualified but deprived of University education. Consequently, Affiliated University colleges were established in Makandura, Kuliyapitiya and Anuradhapura. Subsequently on 07th of November 1995, the Affiliated Universities were amalgamated and the affiliated university of Kuliyapitiya and Makandura were named as Wayamba Campus of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka.<br><br>At the inception, four faculties namely Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Faculty of Management Studies, Faculty of Agriculture and Faculty of Applied Sciences were established and in the year 2006, the Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences was established as the fifth faculty of RUSL. The faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities, Faculty of Management Studies and Faculty of Applied Sciences are conveniently located in the Mihintale premises while the Faculties of Agriculture and Medicine and Allied Sciences are situated in Puliyankulama and Saliyapura respectively.

During the past sixteen years, the contribution made to tertiary education by Rajarata University of Sri Lanka is immense.</p>

						  <p><i>"Our aim is to develop Rajarata University into an institution that produces viable scholars appropriate to the 21st century. According to a survey conducted by the World Economic Forum, there are four types of intellectual skills required for the 21st century. These skills have been identified as;  technical skills, intellectual skills, management skills and  business Skills. In this way, Harvard University also revealed that over fifty percent of the jobs created by humans in the next 10 years would be snatched away by artificial intelligence, that is, by robots. All that is left for man to do is analytical thinking with creative abilities and activities that are guided by conscience."</i></p>

					      <h3>Prof. B.Ananda Karunaratne</h3>
						  <p><i>"By 2020, not a single university in Asia is among the top 10 universities in the world. Not a single university in South Asia has been ranked among the top 100 universities in the world. We must first aim to be among the top 100 universities in the world and secondly among the top 10. It is not an exaggeration. The highest wisdom in the world is originated in Asian countries. Meanwhile, we the Sri Lankans have done unique work in the world in a number of fields. We must bring forward our traditional knowledge as well as innovations that can be adapted to the new world. To this end, research work should be expedited. It is also necessary to endow the society with a scholar full of human qualities. Being located in a historical academic area, our university is a place where all these objectives can be achieved. I strongly believe that this website is also a valuable opportunity to embark on that journey. So, I vehemently offer my best regards"</i></p>
